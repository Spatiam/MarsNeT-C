.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The Interplanetary Overlay Network (\s-1ION\s0) software distribution is an
implementation of Delay-Tolerant Networking (\s-1DTN\s0) architecture as described
in Internet \s-1RFC 4838. \s0 It is designed to enable inexpensive insertion of
\&\s-1DTN\s0 functionality into embedded systems such as robotic spacecraft.  The
intent of \s-1ION\s0 deployment in space flight mission systems is to reduce
cost and risk in mission communications by simplifying the construction
and operation of automated digital data communication networks spanning
space links, planetary surface links, and terrestrial links.
.PP
The \s-1ION\s0 distribution comprises the following software packages:
.Sp
.RS 4
\&\fIici\fR (Interplanetary Communication Infrastructure), a set of general-purpose
libraries providing common functionality to the other packages.
.Sp
\&\fIltp\fR (Licklider Transmission Protocol), a core \s-1DTN\s0 protocol that provides
transmission reliability based on delay-tolerant acknowledgments, timeouts,
and retransmissions.
.Sp
\&\fIdgr\fR (Datagram Retransmission), a library that enables data to be
transmitted via \s-1UDP\s0 with reliability comparable to that provided by \s-1TCP.  DGR\s0
is an alternative implementation of \s-1LTP,\s0 designed for use within an internet.
.Sp
\&\fIbssp\fR (Bundle Streaming Service Protocol), a protocol that supports
delay-tolerant data streaming.  \s-1BSSP\s0 delivers data in transmission order
with minimum latency but possibly with omissions, for immediate display,
and at the same time it delivers the same data reliably in background so
that the streamed data can be \*(L"rewound\*(R" for possibly improved presentation.
.Sp
\&\fIbp\fR (Bundle Protocol), a core \s-1DTN\s0 protocol that provides delay-tolerant
forwarding of data through a network in which continuous end-to-end
connectivity is never assured, including support for delay-tolerant
dynamic routing.  The Bundle Protocol (\s-1BP\s0) specification is defined
in Internet \s-1RFC 5050.\s0
.Sp
\&\fIams\fR (Asynchronous Message Service), \fIcfdp\fR (\s-1CCSDS\s0 File Delivery
Protocol), \fIdtpc\fR (Delay-Tolerant Payload Conditioning), and \fIbss\fR
(Bundle Streaming Service), application-layer services that are not part
of the \s-1DTN\s0 architecture but utilize underlying \s-1DTN\s0 protocols.
.RE
.PP
Taken together, the packages included in the \s-1ION\s0 software distribution
constitute a communication capability characterized by the following
operational features:
.Sp
.RS 4
Reliable conveyance of data over a \s-1DTN,\s0 i.e., a network in which it might
never be possible for any node to have reliable information about the
detailed current state of any other node.
.Sp
Built on this capability, reliable distribution of short messages to multiple
recipients (subscribers) residing in such a network.
.Sp
Management of traffic through such a network.
.Sp
Facilities for monitoring the performance of the network.
.Sp
Robustness against node failure.
.Sp
Portability across heterogeneous computing platforms.
.Sp
High speed with low overhead.
.Sp
Easy integration with heterogeneous underlying communication infrastructure,
ranging from Internet to dedicated spacecraft communication links.
.RE
.PP
While most of the ici package consists of libraries providing functionality
that may be of general utility in any complex embedded software system,
the functions and macros described below are specifically designed to support
operations of \s-1ION\s0's delay-tolerant networking protocol stack.
.IP "\s-1TIMESTAMPBUFSZ\s0" 4
.IX Item "TIMESTAMPBUFSZ"
This macro returns the recommended size of a buffer that is intended to
contain a timestamp in ION-standard format:

.IP "int \fIionAttach()\fR" 4
.IX Item "int ionAttach()"
Attaches the invoking task to \s-1ION\s0 infrastructure as previously established
by running the \fIionadmin\fR utility program.  Returns zero on success, \-1 on
any error.
.IP "void \fIionDetach()\fR" 4
.IX Item "void ionDetach()"
Detaches the invoking task from \s-1ION\s0 infrastructure.  In particular, releases
handle allocated for access to \s-1ION\s0's non-volatile database.  \fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR, though,
that \fIionDetach()\fR has no effect when the invoking task is running in a
non-memory-protected environment, such as VxWorks, where all \s-1ION\s0 resource
access variables are shared by all tasks: no single task could detach
without crashing all other \s-1ION\s0 tasks.
.IP "void ionProd(uvast fromNode, uvast toNode, unsigned int xmitRate, unsigned int owlt)" 4
.IX Item "void ionProd(uvast fromNode, uvast toNode, unsigned int xmitRate, unsigned int owlt)"
This function is designed to be called from an operating environment command
or a fault protection routine, to enable operation of a node to resume when
all of its scheduled contacts are in the past (making it impossible to use
a \s-1DTN\s0 communication contact to assert additional future communication
contacts).  The function asserts a single new unidirectional contact
conforming to the arguments provided, including the applicable one-way light
time, with start time equal to the current time (at the moment of execution
of the function) and end time equal to the start time plus 2 hours.  The
result of executing the function is written to the \s-1ION\s0 log using standard
\&\s-1ION\s0 status message logging functions.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0\fR that the \fIionProd()\fR function must be invoked twice in order
to establish bidirectional communication.
.IP "void \fIionTerminate()\fR" 4
.IX Item "void ionTerminate()"
Shuts down the entire \s-1ION\s0 node, terminating all daemons.  The state of 
the node is retained in the node's \s-1SDR\s0 heap.
.IP "int ionStartAttendant(ReqAttendant *attendant)" 4
.IX Item "int ionStartAttendant(ReqAttendant *attendant)"
Initializes the semaphore in \fIattendant\fR so that it can be used for blocking
\&\s-1ZCO\s0 space requisitions by \fIionRequestZcoSpace()\fR.  Returns 0 on success,
\&\-1 on any error.
.IP "void ionPauseAttendant(ReqAttendant *attendant)" 4
.IX Item "void ionPauseAttendant(ReqAttendant *attendant)"
\&\*(L"Ends\*(R" the semaphore in \fIattendant\fR so that the task that is blocked on
taking it is interrupted and may respond to an error or shutdown condition.
.IP "void ionResumeAttendant(ReqAttendant *attendant)" 4
.IX Item "void ionResumeAttendant(ReqAttendant *attendant)"
Reinitializes the semaphore in \fIattendant\fR so that it can again be used
for blocking \s-1ZCO\s0 space requisitions.
.IP "void ionStopAttendant(ReqAttendant *attendant)" 4
.IX Item "void ionStopAttendant(ReqAttendant *attendant)"
Destroys the semaphore in \fIattendant\fR, preventing a potential resource leak.
.IP "int ionRequestZcoSpace(ZcoAcct acct, vast fileSpaceNeeded, vast bulkSpaceNeeded, vast heapSpaceNeeded, unsigned char coarsePriority, unsigned char finePriority, ReqAttendant *attendant, ReqTicket *ticket)" 4
.IX Item "int ionRequestZcoSpace(ZcoAcct acct, vast fileSpaceNeeded, vast bulkSpaceNeeded, vast heapSpaceNeeded, unsigned char coarsePriority, unsigned char finePriority, ReqAttendant *attendant, ReqTicket *ticket)"
Lodges a request for \s-1ZCO\s0 space in the pool identified by \fIacct\fR.  If the
requested space can be provided immediately, it is reserved for use by the
calling task.  Otherwise, if \fIattendant\fR is non-NULL then the request is
queued for service when space becomes available.  In any case, \fI*ticket\fR
is set to the address of a \*(L"ticket\*(R" referencing this request.  The status
of the request can be interrogated by calling \fIionSpaceAwarded()\fR.  If this
function returns 1 (True) then \s-1ZCO\s0 space may be consumed immediately and
the ticket must then be destroyed by a call to \fIionShred()\fR.  Otherwise, if
an attendant was provided, then the calling task should pend on the semaphore
in \fIattendant\fR and upon successfully taking the semaphore it must
consume the requested \s-1ZCO\s0 space and then \fIionShred()\fR the ticket.  Otherwise
the request for \s-1ZCO\s0 space has been definitively denied and, as always, the
ticket must by destroyed by an invocation of \fIionShred()\fR.  Returns 0 on success,
\&\-1 on any failure.
.IP "int ionSpaceAwarded(ReqTicket *ticket)" 4
.IX Item "int ionSpaceAwarded(ReqTicket *ticket)"
Returns 1 if \fIticket\fR is for a \s-1ZCO\s0 space request that has been serviced
(\s-1ZCO\s0 space has been reserved per this request), 0 otherwise.
.IP "void ionShred(ReqTicket *ticket)" 4
.IX Item "void ionShred(ReqTicket *ticket)"
Dismisses the reservation of \s-1ZCO\s0 space (if any) requested by the call to
\&\fIionRequestZcoSpace()\fR that returned \fIticket\fR.  Calling \fIionShred()\fR indicates
either that the requested space was reserved (i.e., the request was \*(L"serviced\*(R")
and has been claimed (consumed by the appending of a \s-1ZCO\s0 extent) or that the
request has been canceled.  Note that failure to promptly (within 3 seconds of
reception) \fIionShred()\fR the ticket for a service request will be interpreted as
refusal of the reserved \s-1ZCO\s0 space, resulting in that space being made
available for use by other tasks.
.IP "Object ionCreateZco(ZcoMedium source, Object location, vast offset, vast length, unsigned char coarsePriority, unsigned char finePriority, ZcoAcct acct, ReqAttendant *attendant)" 4
.IX Item "Object ionCreateZco(ZcoMedium source, Object location, vast offset, vast length, unsigned char coarsePriority, unsigned char finePriority, ZcoAcct acct, ReqAttendant *attendant)"
This function provides a \*(L"blocking\*(R" implementation of admission control in
\&\s-1ION. \s0 Like \fIzco_create()\fR, it constructs a zero-copy object (see \fIzco\fR\|(3)) that
contains a single extent of source data residing at \fIlocation\fR in \fIsource\fR,
of which the first \fIoffset\fR bytes are omitted and the next \fIlength\fR bytes
are included.  But unlike \fIzco_create()\fR, \fIionCreateZco()\fR can be configured to
block (rather than return an immediate error indication) so long as the total
amount of space in \fIsource\fR that is available for new \s-1ZCO\s0 formation is less
than \fIlength\fR.  \fIionCreateZco()\fR operates by calling \fIionRequestZcoSpace()\fR,
then pending on the semaphore in \fIattendant\fR as necessary before creating
the \s-1ZCO. \s0 \fIionCreateZco()\fR returns when either (a) space has become
available and the \s-1ZCO\s0 has been created, in which case the location of
the \s-1ZCO\s0 is returned, or (b) the function has failed (in which case
((Object) \-1) is returned), or (c) either \fIattendant\fR was null and sufficient
space for the first extent of the \s-1ZCO\s0 was not immediately available or else
the function was interrupted by \fIionPauseAttendant()\fR before space for the
\&\s-1ZCO\s0 became available (in which case 0 is returned).
.IP "vast ionAppendZcoExtent(Object zco, ZcoMedium source, Object location, vast offset, vast length, unsigned char coarsePriority, unsigned char finePriority, ReqAttendant *attendant)" 4
.IX Item "vast ionAppendZcoExtent(Object zco, ZcoMedium source, Object location, vast offset, vast length, unsigned char coarsePriority, unsigned char finePriority, ReqAttendant *attendant)"
Similar to \fIionCreateZco()\fR except that instead of creating a new \s-1ZCO\s0 it appends
an additional extent to an existing \s-1ZCO. \s0 Returns \-1 on failure, 0 on
interruption by \fIionPauseAttendant()\fR or if \fIattendant\fR was \s-1NULL\s0 and sufficient
space for the extent was not immediately available, \fIlength\fR on success.
.IP "Sdr \fIgetIonsdr()\fR" 4
.IX Item "Sdr getIonsdr()"
Returns a pointer to the \s-1SDR\s0 management object, previously acquired by calling
\&\fIionAttach()\fR, or zero on any error.
.IP "PsmPartition \fIgetIonwm()\fR" 4
.IX Item "PsmPartition getIonwm()"
Returns a pointer to the \s-1ION\s0 working memory partition, previously acquired
by calling \fIionAttach()\fR, or zero on any error.
.IP "int \fIgetIonMemoryMgr()\fR" 4
.IX Item "int getIonMemoryMgr()"
Returns the memory manager \s-1ID\s0 for operations on \s-1ION\s0's working memory partition,
previously acquired by calling \fIionAttach()\fR, or \-1 on any error.
.IP "int \fIionLocked()\fR;" 4
.IX Item "int ionLocked();"
Returns 1 if the calling task is the owner of the current \s-1SDR\s0 transaction.
Assuring that \s-1ION\s0 is locked while related critical operations are performed
is essential to the avoidance of race conditions.
.IP "uvast \fIgetOwnNodeNbr()\fR" 4
.IX Item "uvast getOwnNodeNbr()"
Returns the Bundle Protocol node number identifying this node, as
declared when \s-1ION\s0 was initialized by \fIionadmin\fR.
.IP "time_t \fIgetCtime()\fR" 4
.IX Item "time_t getCtime()"
Returns the current calendar (i.e., Unix epoch) time, as computed from local
clock time and the computer's current offset from \s-1UTC \s0(due to clock drift,
\&\fBnot\fR due to time zone difference; the \fButcdelta\fR) as managed from
\&\fIionadmin\fR.
.IP "int \fIionClockIsSynchronized()\fR" 4
.IX Item "int ionClockIsSynchronized()"
Returns 1 if the computer on which the local \s-1ION\s0 node is running has a
synchronized clock , i.e., a clock that reports the current calendar (i.e.,
Unix epoch) time as a value that differs from the correct calendar time by
an interval approximately equal to the currently asserted offset from \s-1UTC\s0
due to clock drift; returns zero otherwise.
.Sp
If the machine's clock is synchronized then its reported values (as returned
by \fIgetCtime()\fR) can safely be used as the creation times of new bundles and
the expiration time of such a bundle can accurately be computed as the sum
of the bundle's creation time and time to live.  If not, then the creation
timestamp time of new bundles sourced at the local \s-1ION\s0 node must be zero
and the creation timestamp sequence numbers must increase monotonically
forever, never rolling over to zero.
.IP "void writeTimestampLocal(time_t timestamp, char *timestampBuffer)" 4
.IX Item "void writeTimestampLocal(time_t timestamp, char *timestampBuffer)"
Expresses the time value in \fItimestamp\fR as a local timestamp string in
ION-standard format, as noted above, in \fItimestampBuffer\fR.
.IP "void writeTimestampUTC(time_t timestamp, char *timestampBuffer)" 4
.IX Item "void writeTimestampUTC(time_t timestamp, char *timestampBuffer)"
Expresses the time value in \fItimestamp\fR as a \s-1UTC\s0 timestamp string in
ION-standard format, as noted above, in \fItimestampBuffer\fR.
.IP "time_t readTimestampLocal(char *timestampBuffer, time_t referenceTime)" 4
.IX Item "time_t readTimestampLocal(char *timestampBuffer, time_t referenceTime)"
Parses the local timestamp string in \fItimestampBuffer\fR and returns the
corresponding calendar (i.e., Unix epoch) time value (as would be returned by
\&\fItime\fR\|(2)), or zero if the timestamp string cannot be parsed successfully.  The
timestamp string is normally expected to be an absolute expression of local
time in ION-standard format as noted above.  However, a relative time
expression variant is also supported: if the first character of
\&\fItimestampBuffer\fR is '+' then the remainder of the string is interpreted
as a count of seconds; the sum of this value and the time value in
\&\fIreferenceTime\fR is returned.
.IP "time_t readTimestampUTC(char *timestampBuffer, time_t referenceTime)" 4
.IX Item "time_t readTimestampUTC(char *timestampBuffer, time_t referenceTime)"
Same as \fIreadTimestampLocal()\fR except that if \fItimestampBuffer\fR is not a
relative time expression then it is interpreted as an absolute expression
of \s-1UTC\s0 time in ION-standard format as noted above.
.SH "STATUS MESSAGES"
.IX Header "STATUS MESSAGES"
\&\s-1ION\s0 uses \fIwriteMemo()\fR, \fIputErrmsg()\fR, and \fIputSysErrmsg()\fR to log several different

\&\fIxxx\fR indicates the type of network activity that the message is reporting
on.  Statistics for eight different types of network activity are reported:
.IP "\fBsrc\fR" 4
.IX Item "src"
This message reports on the bundles sourced at the local node during the
indicated interval.
.IP "\fBfwd\fR" 4
.IX Item "fwd"
This message is about routing; it reports on the number of bundles queued
for forwarding to neighboring nodes as selected by the routing procedure.
When a bundle must be re-forwarded due to convergence-layer transmission
failure it is counted a second time here.
.IP "\fBxmt\fR" 4
.IX Item "xmt"
This message reports on the bundles passed to the convergence layer protocol(s)
for transmission from this node.  Again, a re-forwarded bundle that is then
re-transmitted at the convergence layer is counted a second time here.
.IP "\fBrcv\fR" 4
.IX Item "rcv"
This message reports on the bundles from other nodes that were received at
the local node.
.IP "\fBdlv\fR" 4
.IX Item "dlv"
This message reports on the bundles delivered to applications via endpoints
on the local node.
.IP "\fBctr\fR" 4
.IX Item "ctr"
This message reports on the custody refusal signals received at the local node.
.IP "\fBrfw\fR" 4
.IX Item "rfw"
This message reports on bundles for which convergence-layer transmission
failed at this node, causing the bundles to be re-forwarded.
.IP "\fBexp\fR" 4
.IX Item "exp"
This message reports on the bundles destroyed at this node due to \s-1TTL\s0
expiration.

\&\fItttttttt\fR and \fI\s-1TTTTTTTT\s0\fR indicate the start and end times of the interval
for which statistics are being reported, expressed in \fIyyyy/mm/dd\-hh:mm:ss\fR
format.  \fI\s-1TTTTTTTT\s0\fR is the current time and \fItttttttt\fR is the time of the
prior report.
.Sp
Each of the four value pairs following the colon (:) reports on the number
of bundles counted for the indicated type of network activity, for the
indicated traffic flow, followed by the sum of the sizes of the payloads
of all those bundles.  The four traffic flows for which statistics are
reported are \*(L"(0)\*(R" the priority\-0 or \*(L"bulk\*(R" traffic, \*(L"(1)\*(R" the priority\-1
\&\*(L"standard\*(R" traffic, \*(L"(2)\*(R" the priority\-2 \*(L"expedited\*(R" traffic, and \*(L"(+)\*(R"
the total for all classes of service.

Other status messages are free-form, except that date and time are always noted
just as for the documented status message types.
