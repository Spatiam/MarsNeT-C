.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\s-1LTP\s0 management commands are passed to \fBltpadmin\fR either in a file of
text lines or interactively at \fBltpadmin\fR's command prompt (:).  Commands
are interpreted line-by line, with exactly one command per line.  The formats
and effects of the \s-1LTP\s0 management commands are described below.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
.IP "\fB?\fR" 4
.IX Item "?"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fBh\fR command.
.IP "\fB#\fR" 4
.IX Item "#"
Comment line.  Lines beginning with \fB#\fR are not interpreted.
.IP "\fBe\fR { 1 | 0 }" 4
.IX Item "e { 1 | 0 }"
Echo control.  Setting echo to 1 causes all output printed by ltpadmin to be
logged as well as sent to stdout.  Setting echo to 0 disables this behavior.
.IP "\fBv\fR" 4
.IX Item "v"
Version number.  Prints out the version of \s-1ION\s0 currently installed.  \s-1HINT:\s0
combine with \fBe 1\fR command to log the version number at startup.
.IP "\fB1\fR \fIest_max_export_sessions\fR" 4
.IX Item "1 est_max_export_sessions"
The \fBinitialize\fR command.  Until this command is executed, \s-1LTP\s0 is not
in operation on the local \s-1ION\s0 node and most \fIltpadmin\fR commands will fail.
.Sp
The command uses \fIest_max_export_sessions\fR to configure the hashtable it
will use to manage access to export transmission sessions that are currently
in progress.  For optimum performance, \fIest_max_export_sessions\fR should
normally equal or exceed the summation of \fImax_export_sessions\fR over all
spans as discussed below.
.Sp
Appropriate values for the parameters configuring
each \*(L"span\*(R" of potential \s-1LTP\s0 data exchange between the local \s-1LTP\s0 and
neighboring engines are non-trivial to determine.  See the \s-1ION LTP\s0
configuration spreadsheet and accompanying documentation for details.
.IP "\fBa span\fR \fIpeer_engine_nbr\fR \fImax_export_sessions\fR \fImax_import_sessions\fR \fImax_segment_size\fR \fIaggregation_size_limit\fR \fIaggregation_time_limit\fR '\fILSO_command\fR' [\fIqueuing_latency\fR]" 4
.IX Item "a span peer_engine_nbr max_export_sessions max_import_sessions max_segment_size aggregation_size_limit aggregation_time_limit 'LSO_command' [queuing_latency]"
The \fBadd span\fR command.  This command declares that a \fIspan\fR of potential
\&\s-1LTP\s0 data interchange exists between the local \s-1LTP\s0 engine and the indicated
(neighboring) \s-1LTP\s0 engine.
.Sp
The \fImax_segment_size\fR and \fIaggregation_size_limit\fR
are expressed as numbers of bytes of data.  \fImax_segment_size\fR
limits the size of each of the segments into which each outbound data
\&\fIblock\fR will be divided; typically this limit will be the maximum number
of bytes that can be encapsulated within a single transmission frame of the
underlying \fIlink service\fR.
.Sp
\&\fIaggregation_size_limit\fR limits the number of \s-1LTP\s0 service data units
(e.g., bundles) that can be aggregated into a single block: when
the sum of the sizes of all service data units aggregated into a block
exceeds this limit, aggregation into this block must cease and the block
must be segmented and transmitted.
.Sp
\&\fIaggregation_time_limit\fR alternatively limits the number of seconds that
any single export session block for this span will await aggregation before
it is segmented and transmitted regardless of size.  The aggregation time
limit prevents undue delay before the transmission of data during periods
of low activity.
.Sp
\&\fImax_export_sessions\fR constitutes, in effect,
the local \s-1LTP\s0 engine's retransmission \*(L"window\*(R" for this span.  The
retransmission windows of the spans impose flow control on \s-1LTP\s0 transmission,
reducing the chance of allocation of all available space in the \s-1ION\s0 node's data
store to \s-1LTP\s0 transmission sessions.
.Sp
\&\fImax_import_sessions\fR is simply the neighoring engine's own value for the
corresponding export session parameter; it is the neighboring engine's
retransmission window size for this span.  It reduces the chance of allocation
of all available space in the \s-1ION\s0 node's data store to \s-1LTP\s0 reception sessions.
.Sp
\&\fILSO_command\fR is script text that will be executed when \s-1LTP\s0 is started on
this node, to initiate operation of a link service output task for this
span.  Note that " \fIpeer_engine_nbr\fR" will automatically be
appended to \fILSO_command\fR by \fBltpadmin\fR before the command is executed,
so only the link-service-specific portion of the command should be provided
in the \fILSO_command\fR string itself.
.Sp
\&\fIqueuing_latency\fR is the estimated number of seconds that we expect to lapse
between reception of a segment at this node and transmission of an
acknowledging segment, due to processing delay in the node.  (See the
\&'m ownqtime' command below.)  The default value is 1.
.Sp
If \fIqueuing latency\fR a negative number, the absolute value of this number
is used as the actual queuing latency and session purging is enabled;
otherwise session purging is disabled.  If session purging is enabled
for a span then at the end of any period of transmission over this span
all of the span's export sessions that are currently in progress are
automatically canceled.  Notionally this forces re-forwarding of the \s-1DTN\s0
bundles in each session's block, to avoid having to wait for the restart
of transmission on this span before those bundles can be successfully
transmitted.

.IX Item "c span peer_engine_nbr max_export_sessions max_import_sessions max_segment_size aggregation_size_limit aggregation_time_limit 'LSO_command' [queuing_latency]"
The \fBchange span\fR command.  This command sets the indicated span's 
configuration parameters to the values provided as arguments.
.IP "\fBd span\fR \fIpeer_engine_nbr\fR" 4
.IX Item "d span peer_engine_nbr"
The \fBdelete span\fR command.  This command deletes the span identified
by \fIpeer_engine_nbr\fR.  The command will fail if any outbound segments
for this span are pending transmission or any inbound blocks from the
peer engine are incomplete.
.IP "\fBi span\fR \fIpeer_engine_nbr\fR" 4
.IX Item "i span peer_engine_nbr"
This command will print information (all configuration parameters)
about the span identified by \fIpeer_engine_nbr\fR.
.IP "\fBl span\fR" 4
.IX Item "l span"
This command lists all declared \s-1LTP\s0 data interchange spans.
.IP "\fBs\fR '\fI\s-1LSI\s0 command\fR'" 4
.IX Item "s 'LSI command'"
The \fBstart\fR command.  This command starts link service output tasks for
all \s-1LTP\s0 spans (to remote engines) from the local \s-1LTP\s0 engine, and it starts
the link service input task for the local engine.
.IP "\fBm heapmax\fR \fImax_database_heap_per_block\fR" 4
.IX Item "m heapmax max_database_heap_per_block"
The \fBmanage heap for block acquisition\fR command.  This command declares
the maximum number of bytes of \s-1SDR\s0 heap space that will be occupied by the
acquisition of any single \s-1LTP\s0 block.  All data acquired in excess of this
limit will be written to a temporary file pending extraction and dispatching
of the acquired block.  Default is the minimum allowed value (560 bytes),
which is the approximate size of a \s-1ZCO\s0 file reference object; this is the
minimum \s-1SDR\s0 heap space occupancy in the event that all acquisition is into
a file.
.IP "\fBm screening\fR { y | n }" 4
.IX Item "m screening { y | n }"
The \fBmanage screening\fR command.
.Sp
The \fBmanage screening\fR command.  This command disables or enables the
screening of received \s-1LTP\s0 segments per the periods of scheduled reception
in the node's contact graph.
.Sp
By default, screening is enabled \- that is, \s-1LTP\s0 segments from a given
remote \s-1LTP\s0 engine (\s-1ION\s0 node) will be silently discarded when they arrive
during an interval when the contact graph says the data rate from that
engine to the local \s-1LTP\s0 engine is zero.  The reason for this is that without
a known nominal reception rate we cannot enforce reception rate control,
which is needed in order to prevent resource exhaustion at the receiving node.
.Sp
Note, though, that the enabling of screening implies that the ranges declared
in the contact graph must be accurate and clocks must be synchronized;
otherwise, segments will be arriving at times other than the scheduled
contact intervals and will be discarded.
.Sp
For some research purposes this constraint may be difficult to satisfy.
For such purposes \s-1ONLY,\s0 where resource exhaustion at the receiving node
is not at issue, screening may be disabled.
.IP "\fBm ownqtime\fR \fIown_queuing_latency\fR" 4
.IX Item "m ownqtime own_queuing_latency"
The \fBmanage own queuing time\fR command.  This command sets the number of
seconds of predicted additional latency attributable to processing delay
within the local engine itself that should be included whenever \s-1LTP\s0 computes
the nominal round-trip time for an exchange of data with any remote engine.
The default value is 1.
.IP "\fBm maxber\fR \fImax_expected_bit_error_rate\fR" 4
.IX Item "m maxber max_expected_bit_error_rate"
The \fBmanage max bit error rate\fR command.  This command sets the expected
maximum bit error rate that \s-1LTP\s0 should provide for in computing the maximum
number of transmission efforts to initiate in the transmission of a given
block.  (Note that this computation is also sensitive to data segment size
and to the size of the block that is to be transmitted.)  The default value
is .0001 (10^\-4).
.IP "\fBm maxbacklog\fR \fImax_delivery_backlog\fR" 4
.IX Item "m maxbacklog max_delivery_backlog"
The \fBmanage max delivery backlog\fR command.  This command sets the limit
on the number of blocks (service data units) that may be queued up for
delivery to clients.  While the queue is at this limit, red segments
are discarded as it is not possible to deliver the blocks to which they
pertain.  The intent here is to prevent resource exhaustion by limiting
the rate at which new blocks can be acquired and inserted into \s-1ZCO\s0 space.
The default value is 10.
.IP "\fBx\fR" 4
.IX Item "x"
The \fBstop\fR command.  This command stops all link service input and output
tasks for the local \s-1LTP\s0 engine.
.IP "\fBw\fR { 0 | 1 | <activity_spec> }" 4
.IX Item "w { 0 | 1 | <activity_spec> }"
The \fB\s-1LTP\s0 watch\fR command.  This command enables and disables production of
a continuous stream of user-selected \s-1LTP\s0 activity indication characters.  A
watch parameter of \*(L"1\*(R" selects all \s-1LTP\s0 activity indication characters; \*(L"0\*(R"
de-selects all \s-1LTP\s0 activity indication characters; any other \fIactivity_spec\fR
such as \*(L"df{]\*(R" selects all activity indication characters in the string,
de-selecting all others.  \s-1LTP\s0 will print each selected activity indication
character to \fBstdout\fR every time a processing event of the associated type
occurs:

.IX Item "a span 19 20 5 1024 32768 2 'udplso node19.ohio.edu:5001'"
Declares a data interchange span between the local \s-1LTP\s0 engine and the remote
engine (\s-1ION\s0 node) numbered 19.  There can be at most 20 concurrent sessions
of export activity to this node.  Conversely, node 19 can
have at most 5 concurrent sessions of export activity to the local node.
Maximum segment size for this span is set to 1024 bytes, aggregation size
limit is 32768 bytes, aggregation time limit is 2 seconds, and the link service
output task that is initiated when \s-1LTP\s0 is started on the local \s-1ION\s0 node
