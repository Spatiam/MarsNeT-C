.SH "NAME"
amsrc \- CCSDS Asynchronous Message Service MIB initialization file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The Management Information Base (\s-1MIB\s0) for an \s-1AMS\s0 communicating entity (either
\&\fBamsd\fR or an \s-1AMS\s0 application module) must contain enough information to
enable the entity to initiate participation in \s-1AMS\s0 message exchange, such
as the network location of the configuration server and the roles and message
subjects defined for some venture.
.PP
\&\s-1AMS\s0 entities automatically load their MIBs from initialization files at
startup.  When \s-1AMS\s0 is built with the \-DNOEXPAT compiler option set, the
\&\s-1MIB\s0 initialization file must conform to the \fIamsrc\fR syntax described
below; otherwise the \fIexpat\fR \s-1XML\s0 parsing library must be linked into
the \s-1AMS\s0 executable and the \s-1MIB\s0 initialization file must conform to the
\&\fIamsxml\fR syntax described in \fIamsxml\fR\|(5).
.PP
The \s-1MIB\s0 initialization file lists \fIelements\fR of \s-1MIB\s0 update information,
each of which may have one or more \fIattributes\fR.  An element may also
have sub-elements that are listed within the declaration of the parent
element, and so on.
.PP
The declaration of an element may occupy a single line of text in the
\&\s-1MIB\s0 initialization file or may extend across multiple files.  A single-line
element declaration is indicated by a '*' in the first character of the
line.  The beginning of a multi-line element declaration is indicated by
a '+' in the first character of the line, while the end of that declaration
is indicated by a '\-' in the first character of the line.  In every case,
the type of element must be indicated by an element-type name beginning
in the second character of the line and terminated by whitespace.  Every
start-of-element line \fBmust\fR be matched by a subsequent end-of-element
line that precedes the start of any other element that is not a nested
sub-element of this element.
.PP
Attributes are represented by whitespace-terminated <name>=<value>
expressions immediately following the element-type name on a '*' or
\&'+' line.  An attribute value that contains whitespace must be enclosed
within a pair of single-quote (') characters.
.PP
Two types of elements are recognized in the \s-1MIB\s0 initialization file:
control elements and configuration elements.  A control element establishes
the update context within which the configuration elements nested within
it are processed, while a configuration element declares values for one
or more items of \s-1AMS\s0 configuration information in the \s-1MIB.\s0
.PP
Note that an aggregate configuration element (i.e., one which may contain
other interior configuration elements; venture, for example) may be presented
outside of any control element, simply to establish the context in which 
subsequent control elements are to be interpreted.
