.SH "NAME"
acsrc \- Aggregate Custody Signal management commands file
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
Aggregate Custody Signal management commands are passed to \fBacsadmin\fR either
in a file of text lines or interactively at \fBacsadmin\fR's command prompt (:).
Commands are interpreted line-by line, with exactly one command per line.  The
formats and effects of the Aggregate Custody Signal management commands are
described below.
.SH "GENERAL COMMANDS"
.IX Header "GENERAL COMMANDS"
.IP "\fB?\fR" 4
.IX Item "?"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fBh\fR command.
.IP "\fB#\fR" 4
.IX Item "#"
Comment line.  Lines beginning with \fB#\fR are not interpreted.
.IP "\fBe\fR { 1 | 0 }" 4
.IX Item "e { 1 | 0 }"
Echo control.  Setting echo to 1 causes all output printed by acsadmin to be
logged as well as sent to stdout.  Setting echo to 0 disables this behavior.
.IP "\fBv\fR" 4
.IX Item "v"
Version number.  Prints out the version of \s-1ION\s0 currently installed.  \s-1HINT:\s0
combine with \fBe 1\fR command to log the version number at startup.
.IP "\fB1\fR <logLevel> [<heapWords>]" 4
.IX Item "1 <logLevel> [<heapWords>]"
The \fBinitialize\fR command.  Until this command is executed, Aggregate Custody
Signals are not in operation on the local \s-1ION\s0 node and most \fIacsadmin\fR
commands will fail.
.Sp
The \fIlogLevel\fR argument specifies at which log level the \s-1ACS\s0 appending and
transmitting implementation should record its activity to the \s-1ION\s0 log file.
This argument is the bitwise \*(L"\s-1OR\*(R"\s0 of the following log levels:
.RS 4
.IP "0x01  \s-1ERROR\s0" 4
.IX Item "0x01 ERROR"
Errors in \s-1ACS\s0 programming are logged.
.IP "0x02  \s-1WARN\s0" 4
.IX Item "0x02 WARN"
Warnings like \*(L"out of memory\*(R" that don't cause \s-1ACS\s0 to fail but may change
behavior are logged.
.IP "0x04  \s-1INFO\s0" 4
.IX Item "0x04 INFO"
Informative information like \*(L"this custody signal is a duplicate\*(R" is logged.
.IP "0x08  \s-1DEBUG\s0" 4
.IX Item "0x08 DEBUG"
Verbose information like the state of the pending \s-1ACS\s0 tree is logged.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The optional \fIheapWords\fR argument informs \s-1ACS\s0 to allocate that many heap words
in its own \s-1DRAM SDR\s0 for constructing pending \s-1ACS. \s0 If not supplied, the 
default value 10000 is used.  Once all \s-1ACS SDR\s0 is allocated,
any incoming custodial bundles that would trigger an \s-1ACS\s0 will trigger a normal,
non-aggregate custody signal instead, until \s-1ACS SDR\s0 is freed.  If your node
intermittently emits non-aggregate custody signals when it should emit \s-1ACS,\s0
you should increase \fIheapWords\fR.
.Sp
Since \s-1ACS\s0 uses \s-1SDR\s0 only for emitting Aggregate Custody Signals, \s-1ION\s0 can still
receive \s-1ACS\s0 even if this command is not executed, or all \s-1ACS SDR\s0 memory is
allocated.
.RE
.IP "\fBh\fR" 4
.IX Item "h"
The \fBhelp\fR command.  This will display a listing of the commands and their
formats.  It is the same as the \fB?\fR command.
.IP "\fBs\fR <minimumCustodyId>" 4
.IX Item "s <minimumCustodyId>"
This command sets the minimum custody \s-1ID\s0 that the local bundle agent may use
in custody transfer enhancement blocks that it emits.  These custody IDs must
be unique in the network (for the lifetime of the bundles to which they
refer).
.Sp
The \fIminimumCustodyId\fR provided is stored in \s-1SDR,\s0 and incremented every time a
new custody \s-1ID\s0 is required.  So, this command should be used only when the
local bundle agent has discarded its \s-1SDR\s0 and restarted.
.SH "CUSTODIAN COMMANDS"
.IX Header "CUSTODIAN COMMANDS"
.IP "\fBa\fR \fIcustodianEid\fR \fIacsSize\fR [\fIacsDelay\fR]" 4
.IX Item "a custodianEid acsSize [acsDelay]"
The \fBadd custodian\fR command.  This command provides information about the \s-1ACS\s0
characteristics of a remote custodian.  \fIcustodianEid\fR is the custodian \s-1EID\s0 for
which this command is providing information.  \fIacsSize\fR is the preferred size
of \s-1ACS\s0 bundles sent to \fIcustodianEid\fR; \s-1ACS\s0 bundles this implementation sends
to \fIcustodianEid\fR will aggregate until \s-1ACS\s0 are at most \fIacsSize\fR bytes (if
\&\fIacsSize\fR is smaller than 19 bytes, some \s-1ACS\s0 containing only one signal will
exceed \fIacsSize\fR and be sent anyways; setting \fIacsSize\fR to 0 causes
\&\*(L"aggregates\*(R" of only 1 signal to be sent).
.Sp
\&\fIacsDelay\fR
is the maximum amount of time to delay an \s-1ACS\s0 destined for this custodian
before sending it, in seconds; if not specified, the default value 15 will be
used.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
.IP "a ipn:15.0 100 27" 4
.IX Item "a ipn:15.0 100 27"
Informs \s-1ACS\s0 on the local node that the local node should send \s-1ACS\s0 bundles
destined for the custodian ipn:15.0 whenever they are 100 bytes in size or have
been delayed for 27 seconds, whichever comes first.
