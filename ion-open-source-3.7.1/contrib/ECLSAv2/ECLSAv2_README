The software contained in this directory consists of the components necessary
to build a fully functional ECLSA (Error Correcting Lin Service Adapter, a
link server adapter mainly intended to be used under the Licklider Transmission
Protocol (LTP), in ION (Interplanetary Overlay Network), the DTN package
written by NASA-JPL.  https://sourceforge.net/projects/ion-dtn/

ECLSAv2 is inspired by (if is not a compliant implementation of) what is
described in the informative document CCSDS 131.5-O-1 Orange Book, Sept. 2014
ERASURE CORRECTING CODES FOR USE IN NEAR-EARTH AND DEEP-SPACE COMMUNICATIONS.

Comprehensive description of ECLSAv2 can be found in:

Coding in Interplanetary Links: the LTP Erasure Coding Link Service
Adapter," in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems,

The software included in this directory is the core of ECLSAv2 (ECLSA version
2), the copyright is of the University of Bologna 2016, and it is released as
free software under GPL v2 and later versions. ECLSAv2 core can be interfaced
with different codecs, using different FECs, developed by other entities (see
below).

2.	contrib/eclsa/libec

The software included in this directory contains the FEC codec developed by
DLR (German Aerospace Center). The copyright is of DLR and it is NOT released
as free software. See details in the libec directory.

3.	contrib/eclsa/openFEC

The software included in this directory contains the FEC codec developed by
the OpenFEC project (core contributors from the French institutions INRIA and
ISAE. It is free software consisting of different parts governed by several
licenses. See http://openfec.org/accueil.html
